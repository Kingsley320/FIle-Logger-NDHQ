What Need To Be Done


1.  User Authentication and Authorization:
Implement a user authentication system where each user has a unique username and password.
Define different user roles such as Directors, Deputy Directors, Assistant Directors, and regular Employees.
Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain features and functionalities based on user roles.
Store user information securely in a database.


2.  Logging Files and Mails:
Create a database schema for logging files and mails, similar to the analog register book.
Fields in the schema include: date, file/mail name, office coming from, office going to, signatures for receipt, etc.
Implement CRUD operations to add, retrieve, update, and delete file/mail entries.
Ensure proper validation of data entered into the system.


3.  Requesting Files from the Pool:
Design a request form for employees to fill when requesting files from the pool.
Include fields such as employee details (name, office), file number, date of request, and signature for authentication.
Upon submission, the request goes to the head of the registry for approval.
If approved, dispatch the requested file to the requesting office.


4.  Monitoring File Locations:
Implement a mechanism to track the location of every file in the system.
Store information about the current location of each file, including the office it was last received in or if it's in the pool.
Provide a search feature to locate specific files based on file number or other criteria.


5.  Additional Features:
Logging system actions: Keep a log of all actions performed within the system, including login attempts, file accesses, and user management operations.
Notifications: Implement email notifications for important events such as file requests, approvals, and dispatches.
Reporting: Generate reports on file movements, request statistics, and user activities for monitoring and auditing purposes.
Dashboard: Create a dashboard interface for Directors to monitor system activities, file locations, and pending requests.


6.  Security Measures:
Implement HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.
Use secure authentication mechanisms such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to prevent unauthorized access.
Implement input validation and sanitize user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Regularly update and patch the system to address security vulnerabilities.


7.  Testing and Quality Assurance:
Conduct thorough testing of the system to ensure functionality, security, and reliability.
Perform unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate different components of the system.
Conduct security audits to identify and address potential security flaws.
Involve stakeholders in user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.


8.  Documentation and Training:
Document the system architecture, data schema, API endpoints, and user roles.
Provide comprehensive user manuals and training materials for users to understand how to use the system effectively.
Conduct training sessions for administrators and users to familiarize them with the system's features and functionalities.
